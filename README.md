# Project: Object-Oriented Programming

This project is part of the *Object-Oriented Programming* course.

Collaborated with [Thodoris Evangelakos ](https://github.com/Thodoris-Evangelakos) on this project. He is a very good developer.

It is the TUC (Technical University of Crete) version of Tic-Tac-Toe in Java, a game made by our prof. Vasileios Samoladas (many thanks to him!), who requested that we implement the
Minimax Algorithm to create an unbeatable Bot.

With this project we came across concepts like the MVC design pattern (Model-View-Controller), but also had the chance to really dive into
a basic decision rule in AI, the Minimax Algorithm, as well as Alphaâ€“beta pruning for faster results.
Also we learnt about the (De)Serialization concept in Java.
